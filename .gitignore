# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in some cases (e.g. if pipenv is installed locally), it may be better to exclude it:
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility and quick releases.
#   However, it may be better to exclude it for libraries or packages intended to be published to
#   PyPI or conda-forge, to avoid pinning dependencies too strongly.
#poetry.lock
#poetry.toml
#.python-version

# pdm
#   Similar to poetry, PDM makes lockfiles optional.
#pdm.lock
#pdm.toml
#.pdm-python

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
